# Gas-Simulation
Gas simulation with graphical PyQt5 interface. you can simulate either an ideal or real gas and calculate some of  its properties as the thermodynamic pressure, the particle velocity distribution, etc. You can also simulate some thermodynamics processes like an isothermal expansion or isochoric heating and calculate the kT.
